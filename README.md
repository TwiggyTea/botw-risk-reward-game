# DESCRIPTION
This is a game about managing risk and reward!
                Your goal is to gain as many points as you can by defeating monsters, without losing all of your hearts.
                First you will choose a weapon. 
                Then you have to choose if you fight the monsters ahead, or if you flee.
                If you flee, your run ends and you get to keep all of your points!
                If you decide to fight there will be a set number of monsters ahead of you, and you must keep battling until all the monsters are defeated, or you lose your hearts.
                If you defeat all of the monsters you restore your health and you will once again choose a weapon and decide if you fight or flee.
                If you lose all of your hearts, that is game over! Your run ends and you lose all of your points!
                Your goal is to keep fighting as long as you can, and flee at just the right moment.
                Good luck!
